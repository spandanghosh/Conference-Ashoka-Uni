         <p><strong>Synthesis Meeting on the Scientific Foundations of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation by Natural Climate Solutions in South Asia</strong></p>

<p>This proposed SARI synthesis project for South Asia is focused on understanding LCLUC patterns and processes related to agricultural landscapes of smallholder tree-based systems and their potential as natural climate solutions. The synthesis shall provide an observation-based evaluation of the degree to which these landscapes are increasing in terms of cover and biomass, and then evaluate what conditions lead to increases in tree and forest cover in South Asia, and under what conditions do improvements in tree and forest cover contribute to improving rural livelihoods. The objective of the proposed SARI South Asia Synthesis Consortium (SARI-SAS) is twofold: 1) synthesize current and recent NASA research on LCLUC to contribute to a fundamental understanding of their patterns and drivers and 2) translate fundamental science into evidence-based contributions to important climate mitigation and adaptation policy for the region</p>

    <p><strong>Registration & Tea</strong></p>
    <p><em>Time: 9.00 am - 10.00 am</em></p>

    <p><strong>Theme 1: Leveraging Trees Outside of Forests: Integrating Socioeconomic and Biophysical Data for Restoration and Community Well-Being</strong></p>
    <p><em>Time: 10.00 am – 11.30 a.m. (Plenary)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Session Leader: Forrest Fleischmann/Pooja Choksi</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Theme Description</strong></p>

    <p>This theme centers on leveraging trees outside of forests (TOF) by integrating socioeconomic and biophysical data for restoration. It emphasizes community well-being, exploring successful TOF restoration projects and the role of local knowledge. The discussion covers policy implications, funding, and related research areas like agroforestry, urban tree restoration, and community forestry.</p>

    <p><strong>Theme 2: Enhancing Tree Cover Outside of Forests (TOF) in Agricultural Landscapes: Assessing Trends, Benefits, and Drivers</strong></p>
    <p><em>Time: 11.30 am – 1.00 pm (Plenary)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Session Leader: Dave Skole/Randy Wynne</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Theme Description</strong></p>

    <p>This theme centers on the assessment of tree cover outside of forests (TOF) in agricultural landscapes, particularly in semi-arid regions, with a focus on India. The objective is to understand the trends, benefits, and drivers of increasing tree cover in smallholder agriculture systems. The research combines remote sensing, field surveys, and econometric analysis to detect and measure TOF, evaluate economic valuations of ecosystem services (ES), and examine the factors driving these trends. By addressing the complexities of TOF expansion and its impact on carbon sequestration and land use transitions, this theme sheds light on the reversal of natural ecosystem conversion and land degradation trends in smallholder agriculture landscapes.</p>

    <p><strong>Theme 4: Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Time: 11.30 – 1.00 pm (Plenary)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Session Leader: Joshua Gray/ Dave Skole/ Forrest Fleischmann</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Theme Description</strong></p>

    <p>This theme focuses on the potential of tree-based agricultural practices to enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EGP) amid challenges posed by climate change. The region has struggled to realize the agricultural transformations seen elsewhere in South Asia. To address future food demand and climate adaptation, this theme explores the adaptive potential of integrating trees into smallholder farming systems. The central hypotheses are that smallholders have already adapted to climate change by adopting tree-based practices, which have mitigated its effects on crop yields. However, socioeconomic barriers hinder widespread adoption. Through innovative remote sensing, statistical modeling, field data collection, and household surveys, this theme aims to quantify contemporary tree-based practices, their impact on resilience, and the barriers to further transformation.</p>

    <p><strong>Theme 5: Moving Toward Net Zero Nature Based Solutions and Trees Outside Forests in South Asia</strong></p>
    <p><em>Time: 9.00 – 10.30 am (Plenary)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Session Leaders: Dave Skole/Randy Wynne/Forrest Fleischmann/Joshua Gray/Aditya Singh</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Theme Description:</strong></p>

    <p>This theme is dedicated to the examination of policy, governance, and political factors that influence tree cover establishment and change in diverse contexts. Four teams have conducted intensive research on government interventions aimed at enhancing tree cover and livelihoods. These interventions fall into three distinct categories: government action with limited public engagement, collaborative governance with livelihood support, and private market action with supportive government policies. The theme seeks to synthesize findings from these interventions and assess their impacts on tree cover and rural livelihoods. It also draws on ecosystem services valuation research to provide insights into the multifaceted outcomes of these interventions.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Impacts on Tree Cover:</strong> Discuss the effects of these interventions on tree cover, canopy, and forest regeneration, as revealed by empirical research.</li>
        <li><strong>Rural Livelihoods:</strong> Examine how these interventions have influenced the livelihoods of rural communities, including their economic and social well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy and Governance Analysis:</strong> Delve into the policy and governance mechanisms that have shaped the outcomes of these interventions and their sustainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Ecosystem Services Valuation:</strong> Discuss the findings related to the economic and ecological valuation of ecosystem services resulting from tree cover changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Drivers:</strong> Explore the political factors that have influenced decision-making in tree planting and afforestation initiatives.</li>
